# KSP Telemetry Grapher

This Python script graphs telemetry data generated by Mechjeb.

To save telemetry, open Mechjeb's Flight Recorder window and click "CSV". The CSV file generated file will be found under `GameData/MechJeb2/Export` of your KSP install.

This script requires Python 3.6+ and [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/).

For usage information, run `ksp-telemetry.py -h`.

It is currently untested on Windows and MacOS.
